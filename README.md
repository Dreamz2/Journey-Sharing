Is a website for everyone to share their favourite books with whoever. Journey Sharing is the place to find

Fiction, and non-Fiction. Journey Sharing will allow users to create an account and add books to either their Favourites List or
Reading Next List. They will be able to share both their list just by sharing their username or Link to their page.

### Mission
To create a website to get more people into reading and for people to share their favourite book or the latest book they have read.
I want to make it as simple as it can be to add any book to either of their list and to share their username for everyone to see
Created a Fullstack application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Have not decided on the backend support yet. However, will decide at a later date. Will include Frameworks like node.js and others at a later date.
